This website was built with the purpose of being incredibly easy to use. After searching around for a CMS that was not WordPress, I came across sanity.io, which blends well with Gatsby. This is awesome because I wanted to not have to worry about SEO in the future, and having a quick loading site is huge.

I went with Gatsby purely for the speed of the static generation because content on the site is not changing often, this is the perfect choice. They also have good plugins for manipulating images and being able to make the blog look different from the other blogs out there. With how easy it is to customise the return from the GraphQL calls.
I'm very tired of seeing cookie cutter blog sites. NO MORE!

I used modular CSS and in retrospect, now finished with the project - I would use functional components. I feel limited by what you can do with module CSS, maybe itâ€™s just a preference that I like to write JavaScript in my CSS! Iâ€™m a big fan of manipulating CSS properties using hooks or other params to get a user experience that is more engaging than landing on a page and nothing ever changes.
